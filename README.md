# MixWise Next + Sanity (Second Instance)

This is a minimal Next.js 14 + Tailwind + Sanity shell for a **second MixWise instance**.
It is intentionally simple so you can:

- Point it at the same or different Supabase + Sanity backends.
- Copy your existing MixWise mixing tool components into `app/mix/page.tsx`.
- Deploy it as a separate Vercel project without touching your current site.
